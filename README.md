# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN

Lung Cancer Detection Using CNN A deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is built to detect lung cancer from medical images like CT scans. The system analyzes visual patterns to classify images as cancerous or not, helping with faster and more accurate diagnosis.
