## Project Overview

Early detection of lung cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This notebook presents a deep learning approach using CNNs to classify lung images as cancerous or non-cancerous. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dataset

- The dataset used consists of labeled lung images for training and testing.
- [Insert dataset source or location, e.g., Kaggle link]
- Images are preprocessed for normalization and augmentation.

## Model Architecture

- Built with TensorFlow/Keras (or specify framework used).
- The CNN consists of multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
- Batch normalization, dropout, and data augmentation techniques are applied.

## Results

- Accuracy and loss curves are provided in the notebook.
- [Insert F1-score, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix or other metrics]
- Example predictions and misclassified images are discussed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohalkarushikesh/AI-ML-Engineer-Notes.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or use Jupyter's built-in package manager for individual libraries.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Lung_Cancer_Detection_using_Convolutional_Neural_Network\ V2.ipynb
   ```
2. Run each cell in order to train and evaluate the model.
3. Customize the notebook for your own dataset or model improvements.

## Future Enhancements

- **Dataset Expansion**: Incorporate larger and more diverse datasets for improved generalization.
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with advanced architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, etc.) for better accuracy.
- **Explainability**: Integrate explainable AI methods (e.g., Grad-CAM, LIME) to visualize model decision-making.
- **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained models to leverage existing knowledge and boost performance.
- **Clinical Integration**: Develop a user-friendly interface for clinicians to use the model in real-world settings.
- **Automation**: Automate hyperparameter tuning (using tools like Optuna or Hyperopt).
- **Cross-validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
- **Deployment**: Package the solution as a web or mobile app for easy access.
